## Startfield Skill Builder Series: The Frenemies Roadmap

This repository contains Python source code that accompanies a series of projects in the Frenemies project line. We start with the first Release which is essential a single python file that implements a CRUD style interface (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for the Frenemies App. This is a really simple (silly even) app where you can track who your friends and enemies are. I'll use a series of branches and releases where interested coders can grab snapshots of the code at the different steps of development.

Release Step1:
This is the simple one file version

Release Step2:
Lets introduce a class and module structure.

Release Step3:
Here we will explore the power and features we can exploit of Git and GitHub for collaboration.

Release Step4:
Lets add some testing to the code base. I know this is a bit far into the project but I didn't want to overwhelm beginners and the very beginning. Now its perfectly fine to overwhelm them! ;-)

Release Step5:
Up until this point we were just using a dictionary and a csv file for our data storage. Let's upgrade to a true database.

Release Step6:
Let's upgrade from essentially a console app to a web based app! We'll use the Flask framework. This can get complicated fast. So this will be a gentle intro and a simple design with a limited number of add ins.

Release Step7:
Now we are really gonna have some fun and add a bunch of bells and whistles to our Flask based Frenemies app!
